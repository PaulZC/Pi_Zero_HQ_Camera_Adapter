## Assembly

- Install the micro SD card in the Pi Zero and attach a Pi Zero Camera Cable to the Pi
- Assemble the Pibow around the Pi using two screws + nuts to hold it together temporarily
- Fix the HQ camera to the adapter using four M2.5 cap screws + nuts
- Attach the camera cable to the camera
- Carefully fold the Pibow over onto the back of the adapter and attach using four M3 screws + nuts (the ones supplied with the Pibow are _just_ about long enough)

You may need to edit the .scad file and increase the diameter of the holes depending on the accuracy of your printer
